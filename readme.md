# British Airways Customer Experience Review

## Introduction

This project was undertaken as part of a virtual internship provided by Forage in collaboration with British Airways. The primary objectives of this project were to scrape and analyze customer reviews from the British Airways website. The analysis aimed to uncover insights using data analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Project Stack

- **Web Scraping**: Data was collected from the British Airways website using Python libraries like `requests` for HTTP requests and `BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML content.

- **Data Processing and Analysis**: The data was processed and analyzed using Python's data manipulation and analysis libraries, including `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `numpy`.

- **NLP Tools**: Natural Language Processing tools such as `nltk` (Natural Language Toolkit) were used for text analysis, including sentiment analysis and text preprocessing.

- **Machine Learning**: Machine learning techniques were applied for text classification and sentiment analysis, using tools like `scikit-learn` and `Gensim`.

## Key Tasks

1. **Web Scraping**: Scraped customer reviews and related information from the British Airways website.

2. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned and preprocessed the data for analysis, including handling missing values and text cleaning.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explored the data to understand its characteristics and relationships, creating visualizations to highlight insights.

4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Conducted sentiment analysis on customer reviews to gauge overall sentiment.

5. **Topic Modeling**: Applied topic modeling techniques to identify common themes and topics within the reviews.
